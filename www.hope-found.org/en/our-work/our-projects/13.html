					<strong style="font-family:trebuchet ms,lucida grande,verdana,sans-serif;font-size:x-large;text-align:justify"><img style="float:left;margin-top:1em;margin-right:1em;margin-bottom:1em" src="../../../images/logo.jpg" height="200" width="200"></strong><p style="font-family:trebuchet ms,lucida grande,verdana,sans-serif;font-size:medium;text-align:justify">“Tell me and I’ll forget; show me and I
may remember; involve me and I’ll understand.”<br>
<strong>Chinese proverb</strong></p>
<p style="font-family:trebuchet ms,lucida grande,verdana,sans-serif;font-size:medium;text-align:justify">Education has proven to be the most effective means
and instrument to achieving goals set out in developmental programmes, to
reducing mortality rates, to increasing people’s self consciousness about their
health and to enabling them to take responsibility for their own options. Also,
education has made it possible for millions of people of different communities
around the world to become aware of the things happening around them and to
actively take part in social life. <img style="float:right;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;margin-left:1em" src="../../../images/community.jpg" height="250" width="376"></p>
<p style="font-family:trebuchet ms,lucida grande,verdana,sans-serif;font-size:medium;text-align:justify">In this respect, Hope Foundation is working together
with 15 students of architecture of the Technische Universität (TU) Berlin on
building and erecting a primary school in Bertoua, the capital city of the
eastern region of Cameroon (Est). Construction work began in January 2014 and the
school is expected to be opened in September 2015. With this, the Hope
Foundation is carrying out one of the MDGs (Millenium Development Goals)
according to which universal primary education is to be made available to each
and every child in order to ensure access to schooling. The school in Bertoua
has a two-fold objective: the school will mainly function as a bilingual
pre-school for 50 children aged 3 to 6 years and as a primary school for 250
children who shall be receiving a basic education for six years. Moreover, in the
afternoons it will be used as a centre for training and continual education,
where seminars and skill-gaining workshops will be offered to older youths and
adults.</p>
<p style="font-family:trebuchet ms,lucida grande,verdana,sans-serif;font-size:medium;text-align:justify">The course of
events of the project was planned as follows: in 2013 the preparations for the ‘Rising
Education’ project were initiated with the students of the TU Berlin providing
their designs for the building complex and the Hope Foundation simultaneously
carrying&nbsp;out the acquisition of grants and funding sources and contacting
further partners for the project. The first construction phase went on from January to
March 2014. Durin<img style="float:left;margin-top:1em;margin-right:1em;margin-bottom:1em" src="../../../images/baustelle.jpg" height="267" width="400">g this, the site was straightened and prepared for
construction. At the same time, foundation works and initial masonry was begun
as a first step to constructing the administrative block and the first class
room. In the subsequent second construction phase, set to last from November
2014 to February 2015, as well as the third construction phase, set to last
from March to May 2015, the construction works are to be finalized and the
building complex is to be completed step by step In June and July 2015 the final steps prior to
handing over the school are to take place, such as the installation of
electricity supply, the sanitary blocks etc. Also during this phase, the staff
members of the school are to be selected as well as the students. This shall be
based on meetings and discussions of the ‘Parents Teachers Association’ (PTA),
which will also be established in the course of the upcoming spring.</p><p style="font-family:trebuchet ms,lucida grande,verdana,sans-serif;font-size:medium;text-align:justify">The idea for this project stems from the observation
that Bertoua is one the poorest and most neglected parts of Cameroon and that
there is a large need for schools, educational institutions and improved
educational standards in order to achieve a more preferable development. Schooling
is the key to be able to develop personal strengths in order to later have the
possibility to pursue a good education – this on the other hand being the means
to achieving own occupational goals. This project shall combine the concept of
sustainable construction and the direct involvement of the local population in
the region and the 15 students of architecture. In this way, each and every
member of the commun<img style="float:right;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;margin-left:1em" src="../../../images/kinder%20in%20kamerun.jpg" height="266" width="400">ity can make their own contribution to achieve the goals
set out. Through this project, all parts involved can share and exchange their
knowledge as well as their skills and abilities in order to help the community
and to support the development of Bertoua and the surrounding region. <br></p><p style="font-family:trebuchet ms,lucida grande,verdana,sans-serif;font-size:medium;text-align:justify">In cooperation with 15 students of architecture of
the TU Berlin, the Hope Foundation organizes a range of activities and events
to collect donations. Projects of this sort are always dependant on support in
form of personal time or money. With such help we have been able to lay down
the foundations for our school and have thus achieved first successes. The
further steps towards completing the construction of the multi-purpose school can
be achieved with your help! Every form and size of donations contributes to the
project and is accepted gratefully.</p>
